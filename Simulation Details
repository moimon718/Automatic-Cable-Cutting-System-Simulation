Simulation Details
The Automatic Cable Cutting System Simulation demonstrates how an Arduino-based system can measure, feed, and cut cables automatically, using an ultrasonic sensor for precise length measurement. This is useful in manufacturing, wiring harness production, and automated workshops.

ðŸ”¹ Working Principle
Cable Feeding

A DC motor drives rollers to feed the cable forward.

The feed speed is controlled by the Arduino using PWM.

Length Measurement (Ultrasonic Sensor)

An HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor measures the distance the cable has traveled.

The Arduino continuously monitors this distance until the set length is reached.

Cutting Mechanism

When the target length is reached, the DC motor stops.

A servo motor activates the cutting blade to cut the cable.

Reset for Next Cycle

After cutting, the system resets automatically for the next cable piece.

ðŸ”¹ Components Used in Simulation

ðŸ”¹ Simulation in Tinkercad
The design is created in Tinkercad Circuits.

The .brd file contains the PCB layout for the system.

The Arduino .ino code controls the motor feeding, ultrasonic measurement, and cutting process.

The simulation can be run directly in Tinkercad to visualize the process.
