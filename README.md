# Automatic-Cable-Cutting-System-Simulation
A Tinkercad-based simulation of an automated cable cutting system, featuring length measurement, microcontroller control, and motor-driven cutting mechanism.
It demonstrates how a microcontroller can control cable measurement and cutting operations, automating a task that is usually done manually.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- **Automated measurement** of cable length.
- **Motor-driven feeding** for precise cable movement.
- **Cutting mechanism** triggered at the desired length.
- **Microcontroller-based control** (e.g., Arduino).
- Fully **simulated in Tinkercad**.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. **Open the Tinkercad Design**
   - Import the `.brd` or `.sch` file into [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits).


2. **Upload the Code**
   - Use the provided Arduino `.ino` file in the `code` folder.
   - Upload it to the microcontroller in Tinkercad.

3. **Run the Simulation**
   - Start the simulation to watch the automated cable cutting process.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
